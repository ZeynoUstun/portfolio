<p><strong><a href="http://burak-arikan.com/saveas-socialmemory/">Save As Social Memory</a> </strong>| <small>2013</small> | One of the major concerns during the Gezi resistance was how to keep the memories of pain, grief, anger, gains and losses alive. This symposium brought together three artists, a curator, and an academic who works in the area of software art, archive, and media archaeology to critically approach Gezi resistance and its link to social memory. I assisted the organizers to create the editorial content and carried out the translations. </p>
